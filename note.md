### ROUGH TO-DO LIST

| Idx | Task                     | Status      |
| --- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| 1   | Work on the UI           | In progress |
| 2   |                          |             |
| 3   | Replace Fetch with Axios | In Progress |

1.  work on the UI : in progress
<!-- 2. add tests -->

stacking the notes box into one another

- the card can be made equal lengths like a sticky note
- OR they can be manipulated using transform: translate(1px, -260px); like google keep's.
  It is actually a really brilliant technique

3. Replace fetch with axios
4. When you click on the box, it should pop out with all the details
5. Add prompt before deleting
6. Authentication so that notes are attached to a particular user
7. Introduce labels to note
8. I should be able to edit my notes
9. Replace *Loading...* with UI icon

### Observation

1. Content is a required field but data without content still gets saved to the database. This should not be.
2. deleting note crashes the application
