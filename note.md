<!-- 1. work on the UI -->
<!-- add tests -->

- the card can be made equal lengths like a sticky note
- OR they can be manipulated using     transform: translate(1px, -260px); like google keep's.
It is actually a really brilliant technique

3. Replace fetch with axios
4. When you click on the box, it should pop out with all the details
5. Add prompt before deleting
6. Authentication so that notes are attached to a particular user
7. Introduce labels to note
8. I should be able to edit my notes
