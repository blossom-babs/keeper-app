| Idx | Task                     | Status      | Type |
| --- | ------------------------ | ----------- | ---- |
| 1   | Work on the UI           |  🚲         | Feature | 
| 2   | ReactDOM.render is no longer being supported | ✅  | Bug |             
| 3   | Replace Fetch with Axios | ✅ | Chore | 
| 4   | When you click on the box, it should pop out with all the details | ✅ | Feature |

1.  work on the UI : in progress
<!-- 2. add tests -->

stacking the notes box into one another

- the card can be made equal lengths like a sticky note
- OR they can be manipulated using transform: translate(1px, -260px); like google keep's.
  It is actually a really brilliant technique


5. Add prompt before deleting
6. Authentication so that notes are attached to a particular user
7. Introduce labels to note
8. I should be able to edit my notes
9. Replace *Loading...* with UI icon
10. 
11. Make a clone of note


<!-- handle close is actually not working yet -->

### Observation

1. Content is a required field but data without content still gets saved to the database. This should not be.
2. deleting note crashes the application
